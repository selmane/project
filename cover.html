[Client name],

After reading over your application this looks like a perfect fit for my skill sets. I have built a large number of corporate websites, specifically on the Squarespace platform. 

My name is Jake Jorgovan and I am an American Web Designer and Squarespace expert. I love Squarespace and I have a large portfolio of sites built specifically on this platform. 

Below you can see a portfolio of my recent Squarespace projects.

While I am certain there will be others who underbid me on this project, I can assure you several things. 

    I work extremely fast
    I have a great design sense for American corporate design
    I am an American and a native English speaker. This means I can ensure quality communication in regards to the project.

A few questions I have for you about the project:

    Why are you rebuilding the site?
    What is the link to the current Squarespace site in progress?
    What is the purpose of the site?
    What features and functionality are you looking for in the site?

Thank you and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.
